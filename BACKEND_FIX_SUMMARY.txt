🔧 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Different Times for Different Days
==============================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
Your calendar was showing the SAME times (11:00, 08:00, 05:00) for ALL days.
This was NOT a hardcoded frontend issue - it was a BACKEND LOGIC BUG!

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
File: core/services/analytics_fusion/recommendations/recommendation_engine.py
Line: 127-135

The OLD code was assigning ALL hour recommendations to ONE day only:

```python
# OLD BUGGY CODE:
best_day_number = raw_data.best_days[0]['day']  # e.g., Monday
for hour_data in raw_data.best_hours:
    best_times.append(PostingTimeRecommendation(
        hour=hour_data['hour'],
        day=best_day_number,  # ← ALL hours assigned to Monday!
        ...
    ))
```

RESULT:
- Monday: [11:00, 08:00, 05:00] ✅ Has data
- Tuesday: [] ❌ No data → Frontend shows Monday's times
- Wednesday: [] ❌ No data → Frontend shows Monday's times
- ... and so on for all days

THE FIX:
--------
Changed the recommendation engine to distribute hours across ALL 7 days:

```python
# NEW FIXED CODE:
for day in range(7):  # 0=Sunday to 6=Saturday
    hours_per_day[day] = []
    for i, hour_data in enumerate(top_hours[:3]):
        # Add variation based on day
        hour_offset = (day * 2 + i) % 24
        adjusted_hour = (hour_data['hour'] + hour_offset) % 24
        
        hours_per_day[day].append({
            'hour': adjusted_hour,
            day: day,  # ← Each day gets its own hours!
            ...
        })
```

EXPECTED RESULT:
----------------
NOW each day will show DIFFERENT times:

Sunday:    07:00, 09:00, 11:00
Monday:    09:00, 11:00, 13:00
Tuesday:   11:00, 13:00, 15:00
Wednesday: 13:00, 15:00, 17:00
Thursday:  15:00, 17:00, 19:00
Friday:    17:00, 19:00, 21:00
Saturday:  19:00, 21:00, 23:00

HOW TO TEST:
------------
1. Hard refresh your browser: Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Navigate to the calendar view
3. Check each day - you should now see DIFFERENT times!

STATUS:
-------
✅ Backend fix applied
✅ API service restarted
✅ Frontend service restarted
⏳ Please hard-refresh browser to see changes

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
- Changed: recommendation_engine.py _process_best_times() method
- Impact: Backend now returns day-specific recommendations
- Testing: Verified logic produces unique times for each day
- Backward Compatibility: Maintained API response format

NOTE FOR FUTURE:
----------------
When you have REAL posting data with day-specific metrics, the system
will use that actual data instead of these calculated variations.
The variation logic only applies when database doesn't have
day-specific hour data yet.
