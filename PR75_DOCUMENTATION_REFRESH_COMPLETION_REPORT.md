## 🏗️ **Architecture Documentation Highlights**

### 1. **Layered Architecture Explanation**
- **Applications Layer** (`apps/`): Entry points and user interfaces
  - `apps/api/`: FastAPI web application with dependency injection
  - `apps/bot/`: Telegram bot with Aiogram framework  
  - `apps/frontend/`: React TWA with modern component structure

- **Business Logic Layer** (`core/`): Domain models and services
  - `core/models/`: Domain entities and business rules
  - `core/services/`: Business logic orchestration
  - `core/repositories/`: Data access abstraction
  - `core/security_engine/`: Authentication and authorization

- **Infrastructure Layer** (`infra/`): Deployment and operational concerns
  - `infra/docker/`: Container configuration and orchestration
  - `infra/db/`: Database migrations and schema management
  - `infra/k8s/`: Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
  - `infra/monitoring/`: Observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana)

### 2. **Application Flow Documentation**
- **API Request Flow**: Client → Auth Middleware → Service → Repository → Database
- **Bot Message Flow**: Telegram → Handler → Service → Repository → Response
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Scheduler → Handler → Service → Notification
- **Security Flow**: Telegram WebApp Auth → JWT → Permission Validation

### 3. **Development Guidelines**
- Clean architecture principles implementation
- Dependency injection patterns
- Testing strategies per architectural layer
- Code quality standards and validation

## 🧪 **Validation Results**

### Test Suite Validation ✅
```bash
=================== test session starts ===================
collected 12 items

tests/test_layered_architecture.py ......    [ 50%]
tests/test_health.py ......                  [100%]

=================== 12 passed in 0.57s ===================
```

### Architecture Validation ✅
- ✅ All import paths use canonical apps/* structure
