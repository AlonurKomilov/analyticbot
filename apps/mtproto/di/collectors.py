"""
MTProto Data Collectors Container
Focused on data collection services and clients

âœ… Phase 4 Note (Oct 19, 2025): MTProto-specific infrastructure
The infra.tg imports here are acceptable because:
1. apps/mtproto is itself an infrastructure adapter for Telegram
2. These are MTProto-specific implementations (AccountPool, ProxyPool, DCRouter)
3. They don't violate Clean Architecture - MTProto layer IS infrastructure
4. Creating protocols for these would add unnecessary abstraction

This is different from apps/api or apps/bot importing infra - those are
application layers that should use protocols. apps/mtproto bridges the
application to Telegram infrastructure, so it needs direct access.
