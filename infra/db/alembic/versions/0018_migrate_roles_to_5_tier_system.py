"""Migrate role system from 4-tier to 5-tier (viewer|user|moderator|admin|owner)

Revision ID: 0018_migrate_roles_to_5_tier_system
Revises: 0017_cache_optimization_indexes
Create Date: 2025-10-23 09:22:52.000000

CRITICAL MIGRATION: This updates user role values in the database.
- Changes: guest ‚Üí viewer, super_admin ‚Üí owner
- Adds: New 'admin' and 'owner' roles to system
- Safe: Includes rollback capability and validation checks

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Database backup created before running
2. Test on staging environment first
3. Verify all services stopped during migration
