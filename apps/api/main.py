# - analytics_advanced_router   ‚Üí SUPERSEDED by analytics_realtime_router + analytics_alerts_router (ARCHIVED)

# - analytics_unified_router    ‚Üí MIGRATED to analytics_insights_router (ARCHIVED)
# 
# Current Clean Architecture: 5 Domain-Separated Analytics Routers
# 1. Core: Dashboard, metrics, overview, trends, top-posts, sources, refresh
# 2. Realtime: Live metrics, performance scoring, monitoring, recommendations
# 3. Alerts: Thresholds, notifications, alert management, monitoring
# 4. Insights: Advanced reports, capabilities, comparisons, channel-data, performance-metrics, trends
# 5. Predictive: AI/ML insights, forecasting, advanced analysis, predictions

# CLEAN ARCHITECTURE REORGANIZATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ
# ===============================================
# Phase 1: Router file renames and import updates
# Phase 2: Domain boundary corrections (analytics separated)  
# Phase 3: Admin god router split into focused routers
# 
# CURRENT ROUTER ARCHITECTURE:
# - /channels ‚Üí channels_router.py (Pure channel CRUD)
# - /admin/channels ‚Üí admin_channels_router.py (Channel administration)
# - /admin/users ‚Üí admin_users_router.py (User administration) 
# - /admin/system ‚Üí admin_system_router.py (System administration)
# - /analytics/insights ‚Üí analytics_insights_router.py (Analytics domain)
# - /system ‚Üí system_router.py (System health, performance)
# - /health, /performance, /initial-data ‚Üí system_router.py
# - /schedule ‚Üí system_router.py  
# - /delivery/stats ‚Üí system_router.py
# 
# ‚úÖ CLEAN ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS ACHIEVED:
# - Single Responsibility Principle: Each router has one focused domain
# - Domain Separation: Clear boundaries between business domains  
# - Maintainability: Easy to understand, modify, and test each domain
# - Scalability: New features can be added to appropriate domains
