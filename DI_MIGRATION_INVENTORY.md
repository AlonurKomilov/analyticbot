# DI Migration Inventory

**Generated:** October 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Track all files that need DI migration

---

## Summary

- **apps/bot/di.py imports:** 1 file (self-reference only)
- **apps/api/di.py imports:** 6 files
- **apps/shared/di.py imports:** 10 files
- **Total files to migrate:** 15 unique files

---

## Files Using apps/shared/di.py (10 files) - HIGH PRIORITY

These are the most common and need migration first:

1. âœ… `apps/api/main.py` - **ALREADY MIGRATED**
   - Uses: `from apps/shared/di import close_container, get_container`
   - Status: Main API already uses apps/di, but also imports from shared
   - Action: Remove apps/shared/di imports, use apps/di exclusively

2. `apps/api/deps.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps/shared/di import Settings as DISettings, init_container`
   - Action: Replace with apps/di container

3. `apps/api/middleware/auth.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps/shared.di import get_container` (2 imports)
   - Action: Change to `from apps.di import get_container`

4. `apps/api/services/initial_data_service.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps.shared.di import get_container`
   - Action: Change to `from apps.di import get_container`

5. `apps/api/services/startup_health_check.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps.shared.di import get_container`
   - Action: Change to `from apps.di import get_container`

6. `apps/bot/di.py` - **TO BE DELETED**
   - Uses: `from apps.shared.di import get_container` (2 imports)
   - Status: Already deprecated, scheduled for deletion
   - Action: Delete entire file after migration

7. `apps/shared/factory.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps.shared.di import get_container`
   - Action: Change to `from apps.di import get_container`

8. `apps/shared/health.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps.shared.di import Container, get_container`
   - Action: Change to `from apps.di import get_container`

---

## Files Using apps/api/di.py (6 files) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

1. `apps/api/deps.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps.api.di import container` (3 imports)
   - Action: Replace with apps/di

2. `apps/api/main.py` - **NEEDS CLEANUP**
   - Uses: `import apps.api.di as api_di`
   - Action: Remove this import (already uses apps/di and apps/shared/di)

3. `apps/api/routers/system_router.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps.api.di import container`
   - Action: Replace with apps/di

4. `apps/demo/routers/main.py` - **NEEDS MIGRATION**
   - Uses: `from apps.api.di import configure_services, container`
   - Action: Replace with apps/di

---

## Files Using apps/bot/di.py (1 file) - LOW PRIORITY

1. `apps/bot/di.py` - **SELF-REFERENCE**
   - This is the deprecated file itself
   - Action: Delete after verifying no external usage

---

## Migration Order

### Phase 1: Critical API Files (Day 1)
1. âœ… `apps/api/middleware/auth.py` - Auth is critical
2. âœ… `apps/api/deps.py` - Used by all endpoints
3. âœ… `apps/api/main.py` - Entry point (cleanup)

### Phase 2: API Services (Day 1)
4. âœ… `apps/api/services/startup_health_check.py`
5. âœ… `apps/api/services/initial_data_service.py`
6. âœ… `apps/api/routers/system_router.py`

### Phase 3: Shared Code (Day 2)
7. âœ… `apps/shared/factory.py` - Used by many services
8. âœ… `apps/shared/health.py`

### Phase 4: Demo & Cleanup (Day 2)
9. âœ… `apps/demo/routers/main.py`
10. âœ… Delete `apps/bot/di.py`
11. âœ… Consider: Delete or deprecate `apps/api/di.py`
12. âœ… Consider: Delete or refactor `apps/shared/di.py`

---

## Migration Template

For each file, follow this pattern:

**BEFORE:**
```python
from apps.shared.di import get_container

async def my_function():
    container = get_container()
    user_repo = await container.user_repository()
```

**AFTER:**
```python
from apps.di import get_container

async def my_function():
    container = get_container()
    user_repo = await container.database.user_repo()  # Note namespace change
```

---

## Verification Steps

After each migration:

1. âœ… Update imports
2. âœ… Fix namespace (container.X â†’ container.database.X)
3. âœ… Add await if needed
4. âœ… Run file through Python syntax checker
5. âœ… Test the specific functionality
6. âœ… Update this tracking document

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All 15 files migrated
- [ ] No imports from apps/bot/di.py
- [ ] No imports from apps/api/di.py (or file deleted)
- [ ] Minimal imports from apps/shared/di.py (or file refactored)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Status:** ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS  
**Next Action:** Start Phase 1 - migrate auth.py
