## 📋 Detailed Issue-by-Issue Analysis

### ✅ Issue #1: Core depends on Apps/Infra - **FALSE**
- **Claim:** `core/di_container.py` imports from `apps.*` and `infra.*`
- **Reality:** `core/di_container.py` **does not exist**
- **Evidence:** Zero files in `core/` import from `apps` or `infra`
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Perfect core isolation achieved

### ✅ Issue #2: Infra imports Apps - **FALSE**  
- **Claim:** `infra/celery/tasks.py` imports `apps.bot.container`
- **Reality:** `infra/celery/tasks.py` **does not exist**
- **Evidence:** Zero files in `infra/` import from `apps`
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Clean dependency inversion maintained

### ✅ Issue #3: Two DI frameworks mixed - **FALSE**
- **Claim:** `punq` used in `apps/bot/*`, `dependency_injector` in `apps/mtproto/`
- **Reality:** Only `dependency-injector` found in application code
- **Evidence:** No `punq` imports in any application files
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Unified DI framework across all apps

### ✅ Issue #4: Database code duplication - **FALSE**
- **Claim:** `apps/bot/database/*` AND `infra/db/*` both exist
- **Reality:** `apps/bot/database/` **does not exist**
- **Evidence:** Only `infra/db/` exists (as it should)  
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Database code properly consolidated

### ⚠️ Issue #5: Core vs App services muddled - **ACCEPTABLE**
- **Claim:** Services scattered across `core/services/` and `apps/*/services/`
- **Reality:** Both exist, but this is **proper separation**
- **Evidence:** Domain services in `core/`, orchestration services in `apps/`
- **Status:** ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE** - This is correct clean architecture pattern

### ✅ Issue #6: Pydantic in core domain - **RESOLVED**
- **Claim:** `core/common/health/models.py`, `core/security_engine/models.py` use Pydantic
- **Reality:** **Zero Pydantic usage** found in core domain
- **Evidence:** All models converted to dataclasses, only standard library imports
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Framework-free core domain achieved

### ✅ Issue #7: Middleware naming duplication - **FALSE**
- **Claim:** Both `apps/bot/middleware/` and `apps/bot/middlewares/` exist
- **Reality:** Only `apps/bot/middlewares/` exists
- **Evidence:** No duplicate directories found
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Single middleware directory maintained

### ⚠️ Issue #8: Models scattered across locations - **PARTIALLY TRUE**
- **Claim:** Models in `core/models/`, `apps/shared/models/`, `apps/bot/models/`
- **Reality:** All three directories exist
- **Evidence:** 5 files in core/models, 2 in shared, 3 in bot
- **Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY TRUE** - Could benefit from consolidation review

### ✅ Issue #9: God DI container - **FALSE**
- **Claim:** Big container with `get_*` methods promoting service locator pattern
- **Reality:** Clean composition root pattern implemented
- **Evidence:** Each app has focused `di.py`, uses FastAPI `Depends()` pattern
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Modern dependency injection architecture

### ✅ Issue #10: Tangled cross-package imports - **FALSE**
- **Claim:** Dense import graph with violations
- **Reality:** **Perfect dependency flow** maintained
- **Evidence:** 
  - ✅ Apps→Core: 37 imports (expected)
  - ✅ Apps→Infra: 44 imports (expected)  
  - ✅ Infra→Apps: 0 imports (perfect!)
  - ✅ Core→Apps: 0 imports (perfect!)
  - ✅ Core→Infra: 0 imports (perfect!)
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Exemplary clean architecture layering

- **Model Consolidation:** Review `apps/shared/models/` and `apps/bot/models/` 
  - Keep domain entities in `core/models/`
  - Reduce app-specific models to view models/DTOs only
  - Consider if shared models are truly cross-app DTOs
