### Step 2: Create Webhook Endpoint
1. Click **"Add endpoint"**
2. Enter your endpoint URL:
   ```
   https://api.your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook/stripe
   ```
   *Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain*

### Step 3: Select Events to Listen For
Select these essential events for the payment system:

#### Payment Events
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded` - Successful one-time payments
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Failed payments
- ‚úÖ `payment_method.attached` - Payment method added to customer

#### Subscription Events
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription created
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription changes (plan, status)
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription cancelled
- ‚úÖ `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Subscription renewal successful
- ‚úÖ `invoice.payment_failed` - Subscription renewal failed

#### Customer Events
- ‚úÖ `customer.created` - New customer record
- ‚úÖ `customer.updated` - Customer information changed
- ‚úÖ `customer.deleted` - Customer account deleted

### Step 4: Configure Webhook Settings
- **Description**: "AnalyticBot Payment System"
- **URL**: `https://api.your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook/stripe`
- **Version**: Latest API version (recommended)

### Step 5: Get Webhook Signing Secret
1. After creating the webhook, click on it to view details
2. In the **Signing secret** section, click **"Reveal"**
3. Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`)
4. Update your production environment:
   ```bash
   # In .env.production
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_webhook_secret_here
   ```

## üß™ Testing Webhook Configuration

### Test 1: Webhook Endpoint Accessibility
```bash
# Test if your endpoint is accessible
curl -X POST https://api.your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "webhook"}'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request (Missing Stripe signature)
# This confirms the endpoint is reachable
```

### Test 2: Stripe Webhook Test
1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to your webhook
2. Click **"Send test webhook"**
3. Select `payment_intent.succeeded` event
4. Click **"Send test webhook"**
5. Check the **Response** tab for status 200

### Test 3: Real Payment Test
1. Create a test subscription in your application
2. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Check webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard
4. Verify payment status updates in your application

## üîç Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Webhook Delivery Monitoring
1. **Stripe Dashboard**: Monitor webhook delivery status
2. **Application Logs**: Check payment service logs
3. **Database**: Verify webhook events are recorded

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Webhook Returns 400/401 Error
**Solution**: 
- Verify webhook signing secret is correct
- Check endpoint URL is accessible
- Ensure SSL certificate is valid

#### Issue: Events Not Processing
**Solution**:
- Check selected events match your needs
- Verify webhook handler logic
- Review application logs for errors

#### Issue: Duplicate Events
**Solution**:
- Implement idempotency checks
- Use webhook event IDs to prevent duplicates
- Check for multiple webhook endpoints

### Webhook Logs Access
```bash
# Check webhook processing logs
sudo docker-compose logs api | grep webhook

# Monitor real-time webhook events
sudo docker-compose logs -f api | grep payment
```
