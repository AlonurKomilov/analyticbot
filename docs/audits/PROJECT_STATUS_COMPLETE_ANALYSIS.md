## 🎯 ORIGINAL GOALS VS CURRENT ACHIEVEMENTS

### **WHAT WE WANTED TO ACHIEVE (Original Request):**
```
User asked: "could I ask why do you want remove Unused V2 Systems?"
Then: "could you tell to me more about Option C: Parallel Processing"
Finally: "this option looks good, now you need to learn and audit deeper both of those V1 and for understand those are what they can do now"
Goal: "So yes we can start to do those are and get the best of both worlds!"
```
