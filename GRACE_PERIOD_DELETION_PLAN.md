- [ ] Verify 0 external usages of apps/api/deps.py
- [ ] Confirm unified DI system (apps/di/) is working correctly
- [ ] Run syntax check on key files using new DI system
- [ ] Execute deletions
- [ ] Update APPS_ARCHITECTURE_TOP_10_ISSUES.md
- [ ] Create completion summary document

### October 26 Checklist:
- [ ] Verify 0 external usages of apps/api/di.py

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Lines Removed by Date

| Date | Files | Lines | Cumulative |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| Oct 19 (completed) | 5 files + 8 items | ~182 | 182 |
| Oct 21 (pending) | 2 files | 723 | 905 |
| Oct 26 (pending) | 1 file | 56 | 961 |

**Total Deprecated Code Removal:** 961 lines (73% of identified deprecated code)

---

## üîç Known References (Safe to Delete)

### apps/bot/di.py References:
These are self-references within the deprecated file itself - safe to ignore:
```python
# In apps/bot/di.py (will be deleted)
from apps.shared.di import get_container
# This import is only used within the deprecated file
```

### apps/api/deps.py References:
Based on Phase 1 migration, all external usages have been migrated to:
- `apps/di/api_container.py` (new location)
- Direct imports from `apps.shared.di`

### apps/api/di.py References:
All usages migrated to unified DI system during Phase 1.

## üö® Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If any issues arise after deletions:

### Quick Rollback:
```bash
# Restore from git
cd /home/abcdeveloper/projects/analyticbot
git checkout HEAD -- apps/bot/di.py apps/api/deps.py apps/api/di.py
```

### Investigation Commands:
```bash
# Check what broke
grep -r "apps.bot.di" apps/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "apps.api.deps" apps/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "apps.api.di" apps/ --include="*.py"

# Check import errors
python3 -m py_compile apps/di/*.py
```

## üí° Tips for Execution

### Best Practices:
1. **Execute in the morning** - allows full day for monitoring
2. **Check logs** - monitor application logs for unexpected errors
3. **Test key features** - verify API endpoints and bot functions work
4. **Keep git history** - easy rollback if needed
5. **Update docs immediately** - maintain accurate documentation

### Command Sequence (Oct 21):
```bash
# 1. Verify clean state
cd /home/abcdeveloper/projects/analyticbot
git status

# 2. Verify no new usages
grep -r "from apps.bot.di import" apps/ --exclude-dir=archive
grep -r "from apps.api.deps import" apps/ --exclude-dir=archive

# 3. Create backup branch (optional)
git checkout -b backup/pre-oct21-deletion
git checkout main

# 4. Execute deletions
rm -v apps/bot/di.py apps/api/deps.py

# 5. Verify syntax
python3 -m py_compile apps/di/*.py

# 6. Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor(di): Remove deprecated DI files after grace period
