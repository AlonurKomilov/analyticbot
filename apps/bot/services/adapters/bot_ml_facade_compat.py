Backward Compatibility Wrapper for Bot ML Facade

DEPRECATED: This module is maintained for backward compatibility only.
New code should import from apps.shared.adapters instead.

Moved to apps.shared.adapters.ml_facade as part of Phase 2 Option B
to break APIâ†’Bot cross-dependencies and enable shared access.
