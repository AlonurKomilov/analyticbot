"""
MTProto External Services Container
Focused on external integrations and monitoring

âœ… Phase 4 Note (Oct 19, 2025): Cross-cutting concerns
The infra imports here are acceptable because they represent cross-cutting concerns:
1. Observability (tracing, metrics) - infra.obs.otel
2. Resilience patterns (rate limiting, fault injection) - infra.common
3. These are infrastructure-level concerns that span all layers
4. They don't represent business logic dependencies
5. Cross-cutting concerns are allowed to be used throughout the application

This is consistent with Clean Architecture - cross-cutting concerns like
logging, monitoring, and resilience are infrastructure that all layers can use.
