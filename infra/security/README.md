# Security Infrastructure Policies

This directory contains DevSecOps and CI security configurations:

- `ci-security.yml` - Security scanning configs for CI/CD
- `policies/` - Security policies and compliance configs
- `secrets/` - Secret management configs (not actual secrets)

For runtime security components (auth, models, etc.), see `core/security_engine/`.
