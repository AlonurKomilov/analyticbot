### Phase 5: Format Strategic TODOs (10 minutes)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Analysis Results:**
- Remaining TODO markers: 34 (down from 63)
- Reduction: 46% (29 markers improved/removed)

**Strategic Decision:** KEEP remaining TODOs as inline documentation

**Rationale:**
1. **All tracked:** Every TODO maps to a GitHub issue in GITHUB_ISSUES_TODO_CLEANUP.md
2. **Context provided:** All include details (PLACEHOLDER, Phase references, issue numbers)
3. **Location value:** TODOs at exact implementation site guide developers
4. **Quality verified:** No vague "TODO: Fix this" markers remain

**Remaining TODO Distribution:**
- Repository implementations: 12 → Tracked in Issues #5, #9, #11, #12
- Service integrations: 8 → Tracked in Issues #1, #3, #4, #6
- Payment integration: 3 → Tracked in Issue #7
- Security/Auth: 4 → Tracked in Issues #2, #10
- Export/Features: 7 → Tracked in Issues #14, #15, #16

**Quality Verification:**
- ✅ No vague TODOs
- ✅ All include context
- ✅ All tracked in GitHub Issues
- ✅ All documented in Known Limitations
- ✅ Provide developer guidance at implementation sites
