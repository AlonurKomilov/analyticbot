   docker-compose restart api
   
   # Alternative: Direct process restart
   sudo systemctl restart analyticbot-api
   # or kill and restart the uvicorn process
   ```

2. **Frontend Build** (Optional - hot reload should handle changes)
   ```bash
   cd apps/frontend
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Verification Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test new endpoints
   curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v2/analytics/advanced/dashboard/123"
   
   # Test frontend integration
   # Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/analytics
   # Click "Advanced Analytics" tab
   ```
