"""
Alerts Fusion Microservices Package
===================================

Clean alerts microservices following single responsibility principle.
Replaces AlertsIntelligenceService god object (900 lines) with focused, testable, maintainable services.

Microservices:
- orchestrator: Lightweight coordination service
- monitoring: Real-time monitoring and live metrics
- alerts: Alert configuration, rules, and checking
- competitive: Competitive intelligence and market analysis
- protocols: Service interface definitions

Each microservice is self-contained with clear responsibilities and clean boundaries.

Architecture Benefits:
âœ… No god objects - single responsibility services
âœ… Protocol-based dependency injection
âœ… Clean separation of concerns
âœ… Easy testing and mocking
âœ… Independent scalability
âœ… Maintainable codebase

Transformation Results:
ðŸ”¥ AlertsIntelligenceService (900 lines) â†’ 4 focused microservices
ðŸ“Š Code organized by responsibility instead of size
ðŸŽ¯ Each service has single, clear purpose
