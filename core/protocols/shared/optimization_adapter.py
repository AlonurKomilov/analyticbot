Optimization Service Protocol Adapter
=====================================

Adapter to make AutonomousOptimizationService compatible with OptimizationProtocol.
This breaks the direct dependency while maintaining functionality.

Usage:
Instead of:
  PredictiveIntelligenceService(optimization_service=AutonomousOptimizationService())

Use:
  adapter = OptimizationServiceAdapter(autonomous_optimization_service)
  PredictiveIntelligenceService(optimization_service=adapter)
