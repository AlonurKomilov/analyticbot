## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For New Code (Use New DI)

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Use new modular DI
from apps.di import get_container

container = get_container()
service = await container.bot.bot_client()
repo = await container.database.user_repo()
```

### For Old Code (If Needed)

```python
# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Legacy containers archived
# If you absolutely must access legacy code, see archive/

# These imports will fail after deletion:
# from apps.shared.unified_di import get_container  # DELETED
# from apps.bot.di import configure_bot_container   # DELETED
# from apps.api.deps import get_schedule_service    # DELETED
```

## 🎯 Why Archived?

### Problems with Legacy Containers
- ❌ God Object pattern (729-line unified_di.py)
- ❌ Multiple responsibilities per file
- ❌ Hard to test (mock entire container)
- ❌ Unclear dependencies
- ❌ Duplicate DI logic across 5 files

### Benefits of New Architecture
- ✅ No God Objects (7 focused containers)
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ Average 175 lines per container (76% reduction)
- ✅ Easy to test (mock individual containers)
- ✅ Clear dependencies (explicit composition)
- ✅ 100% type safe
