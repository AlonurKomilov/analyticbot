Health Checker Bridge - Backward Compatibility

This module provides backward compatibility for code that still
imports health_checker from core.common.health.checker.

The actual implementation has been moved to:
apps/api/services/health_service.py

This follows clean architecture principles:
- Core layer: Domain models only (health.models)
- Apps layer: Framework-specific services (health_service)
