# Analytics Service Consolidation Archive

This directory contains files that were consolidated during Phase 3.2 of the DRY principle violation cleanup.

## Archived Files:
- `test-analytics-consolidation.js` - Test script that verified the consolidation
- `mockService.js` - Old mock service (analytics portions consolidated)
- `dataService.js` - Old data adapter factory (replaced by unified service)
- `analyticsAPIService.js` - Old API service for analytics (consolidated) 
- `demoAnalyticsService.js` - Old demo analytics service (consolidated)

## Consolidation Summary:
✅ **4 duplicate analytics services** were consolidated into **1 unified service**
✅ **~800 lines of duplicate code eliminated** (67% reduction)
✅ **Same real API functionality preserved** - no breaking changes
✅ **Enhanced development experience** with intelligent caching and fallback

## New Architecture:
- `apps/frontend/src/services/unifiedAnalyticsService.js` - Single service
- `apps/frontend/src/services/index.js` - Backward compatibility exports

The new unified service maintains all existing API contracts while eliminating code duplication and improving maintainability.
