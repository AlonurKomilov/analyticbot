## 🚨 Emergency Rollback Plan

If something goes catastrophically wrong:

1. **Don't panic** - You have git history
2. **Identify the problem** - Which step caused it?
3. **Revert the commit:** `git revert <commit-hash>`
4. **Or reset branch:** `git reset --hard origin/main`
5. **Document the issue** in blockers
6. **Ask for help** if needed

---

## 💡 Quick Tips

### During Migration
- ✅ Commit after each step
- ✅ Test frequently
- ✅ Use VSCode multi-cursor for bulk edits
- ✅ Take breaks every 2 hours
- ✅ Ask questions when stuck

### When Stuck
1. Check the full plan for details
2. Look at existing migrated features as examples
3. Search for similar patterns in codebase
4. Document the blocker and move to next step
5. Come back to it later

### Time Management
- Don't rush - quality over speed
- Some steps will be faster than estimated
- Some will be slower - that's okay
- Take time to understand, not just copy/paste

**Remember:** This is a marathon, not a sprint. Steady progress wins! 🏃‍♂️💨

**Good luck! You've got this!** 💪🚀
