## 1. Service Integration

### 1.1 Chart Service Not in DI Container

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary Workaround
**Tracking:** GitHub Issue #1
**Priority:** HIGH

**Limitation:**
Chart service is instantiated via factory functions in 4 locations instead of using dependency injection:
- `apps/bot/handlers/admin_handlers.py`
- `apps/bot/handlers/exports.py`
- `apps/api/routers/exports_router.py`
- `apps/api/routers/sharing_router.py`

**Impact:**
- Harder to test (requires factory patching)
- Inconsistent service lifecycle
- Violates DI architecture principles

**Current Workaround:**
```python
# Temporary factory function
def get_chart_service():
    from apps.shared.services.chart_service import create_chart_service
    return create_chart_service()
```

**Planned Resolution:**
Week 2 - Create `ChartServiceProvider` and register in DI container (3 hours)

---

### 1.2 Job Services Use Simulated Processing

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Placeholder Implementation
**Tracking:** GitHub Issue #3
**Priority:** HIGH

**Limitation:**
Analytics and delivery job services contain only simulated processing:
- `AnalyticsJobService.process_analytics_data()` - Returns mock results
- `DeliveryJobService.deliver_scheduled_content()` - Simulates delivery

**Impact:**
- No actual background processing
- Cannot use for production workloads
- Tests don't reflect real behavior

**Current Workaround:**
```python
# Simulated processing
processed_items = len(data)
result = {"status": "completed", "processed_items": processed_items}
```

**Planned Resolution:**
Week 2 - Integrate with core analytics and delivery services (4 hours)

---

### 1.3 Demo Data Service Uses Fallback Pattern

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary Implementation
**Tracking:** GitHub Issue #8
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Limitation:**
`deps_factory.py` uses fallback pattern instead of proper DI container integration.

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent dependency resolution
- Demo mode tightly coupled to factory
- Harder to extend with new services

**Current Workaround:**
Factory checks demo_config and returns appropriate service implementation.

**Planned Resolution:**
Week 3 - Refactor to use core DI container (3 hours)

---

## 2. Dependency Injection

### 2.1 Limited DI Coverage in API Layer

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Coverage
**Tracking:** Multiple issues
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Limitation:**
Some API dependencies still use direct imports or factory functions instead of DI:
- Chart services (4 locations)
- Demo services (deps_factory)
- Some repository instantiations

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent architecture
- Harder to test and mock
- Violates clean architecture boundaries

**Current Workaround:**
Mix of DI and factory patterns based on component maturity.

**Planned Resolution:**
Week 2-3 - Systematic migration to DI container (ongoing)

---

## 3. Repository Layer

### 3.1 Missing Repository Implementations

**Status:** üî¥ Not Implemented
**Tracking:** GitHub Issues #5, #9, #11, #12
**Priority:** HIGH-MEDIUM

**Limitation:**
Several repositories referenced but not yet implemented:
- **SubscriptionRepository** (HIGH priority)
- **AlertSentRepository** (MEDIUM priority)
- **ScheduleRepository** (MEDIUM priority)
- **DeliveryRepository** (MEDIUM priority)

**Impact:**
- Services cannot persist data
- Features incomplete
- Tests use mocks only

**Current Workaround:**
Services use in-memory data or skip persistence entirely.

**Planned Resolution:**
- Week 2: SubscriptionRepository (2 hours)
- Week 3: Alert, Schedule, Delivery repositories (6 hours total)

---

### 3.2 Repository Factory Not Fully Integrated

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Implementation
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Limitation:**
Not all repositories are registered in the repository factory.

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent repository access patterns
- Some code uses direct instantiation

**Current Workaround:**
Direct repository instantiation where factory doesn't provide access.

**Planned Resolution:**
Week 3 - Complete factory integration as repositories are implemented

---

## 4. Authentication & Security

### 4.1 Session Invalidation Not Implemented

**Status:** üî¥ Critical Gap
**Tracking:** GitHub Issue #2
**Priority:** HIGH

**Limitation:**
Admin logout endpoint doesn't actually invalidate sessions. System relies only on JWT expiration (stateless).

**Location:** `apps/api/routers/superadmin_router.py:224`

**Security Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stolen tokens remain valid until expiration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No immediate revocation capability
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot force logout on security incidents

**Current Workaround:**
Short JWT expiration times (15 minutes recommended) mitigate risk.

**Planned Resolution:**
Week 2 - Implement Redis-based token blacklist (2 hours)

**Immediate Mitigation:**
```python
# Ensure short JWT expiration
JWT_EXPIRATION = 15 * 60  # 15 minutes
```

---

### 4.2 Channel Admin Verification Uses Placeholder

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete
**Tracking:** GitHub Issue #10
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Limitation:**
Guard service has placeholder for admin verification via Telegram API.

**Impact:**
- Cannot verify actual channel admin status
- Security check incomplete

**Current Workaround:**
Basic permission checks without Telegram API verification.

**Planned Resolution:**
Week 3 - Integrate with Telegram Bot API getChatMember (2 hours)

---

## 5. Background Jobs

### 5.1 Celery Tasks Use Placeholders

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Placeholder Implementations
**Tracking:** GitHub Issues #17, #18
**Priority:** LOW

**Limitation:**
Several Celery tasks have placeholder implementations:
- `claim_due_posts` - Not implemented
- `requeue_stuck_sending_posts` - Not implemented
- `cleanup_old_posts` - Not implemented

**Impact:**
- Background job scheduling exists but doesn't perform work
- Cannot rely on automated cleanup/processing

**Current Workaround:**
Manual intervention or alternative cleanup mechanisms.

**Planned Resolution:**
Future - Implement with clean architecture patterns (6 hours total)

---

## 6. Payment Integration

### 6.1 Content Protection Payment Integration Missing

**Status:** üî¥ Not Implemented

---

## 8. Export Features

### 8.1 User-Specific Export Settings Not Implemented

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses Defaults
**Tracking:** GitHub Issue #15
**Priority:** LOW

**Limitation:**
Export handler uses hardcoded defaults for channel and period:
```python
channel_id = "@demo_channel"  # Default export channel
period = 30  # Default export period in days
```

**Impact:**
- Users cannot customize export preferences
- Must use default values for all exports

**Current Workaround:**
